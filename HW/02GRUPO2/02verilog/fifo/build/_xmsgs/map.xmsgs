<msg type="error" file="Place" num="1398" delta="new" >A clock IOB / BUFGCTRL clock component pair have been found that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGCTRL site pair. The clock IOB component &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">pclk</arg>&gt; is placed at site &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">E17</arg>&gt;. The corresponding BUFGCTRL component &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="3">pclk_IBUF_BUFG</arg>&gt; is placed at site &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="4">BUFGCTRL_X0Y1</arg>&gt;. The clock IO can use the fast path between the IOB and the Clock Buffer if the IOB is placed on a Clock Capable IOB site that has dedicated fast path to BUFGCTRL sites in its half of the device (TOP or BOTTOM). You may want to analyze why this problem exists and correct it. If this sub optimal condition is acceptable for this design, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint in the .ucf file to demote this message to a WARNING and allow your design to continue. However, the use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design. A list of all the COMP.PINs used in this clock placement rule is listed below. These examples can be used directly in the .ucf file to override this clock rule.
<arg fmt="%s" index="5">&lt; NET &quot;pclk&quot; CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE; &gt;
