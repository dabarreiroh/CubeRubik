Mapping design into LUTs...

Running directed packing...
WARNING:Pack:2912 - The LUT-1 inverter "xclk_INV_8_o1_INV_0" failed to join the
   "OLOGICE2" comp matched to output buffer "xclk_OBUF".  This may result in
   suboptimal timing.  The LUT-1 inverter xclk_INV_8_o1_INV_0 drives multiple
   loads.

ERROR:Place:1398 - A clock IOB / BUFGCTRL clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGCTRL site pair. The clock
   IOB component <pclk> is placed at site <E17>. The corresponding BUFGCTRL
   component <pclk_IBUF_BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGCTRL_X0Y1>. The clock IO
   can use the fast path between the IOB and the Clock Buffer if the IOB is
   placed on a Clock Capable IOB site that has dedicated fast path to BUFGCTRL
   sites in its half of the device (TOP or BOTTOM). You may want to analyze why
   this problem exists and correct it. If this sub optimal condition is
   acceptable for this design, you may use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint
   in the .ucf file to demote this message to a WARNING and allow your design to
   continue. However, the use of this override is highly discouraged as it may
   lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition
   be corrected in the design. A list of all the COMP.PINs used in this clock
   placement rule is listed below. These examples can be used directly in the
   .ucf file to override this clock rule.
   < NET "pclk" CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE = FALSE; >
